Download and run the script as root:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sysadmin-info/openbao/main/openbao.sh
```

Replace `<IP address or URL>` with real IP address or URL and run it before you will run the script. See eg. below:

```bash
sed -i 's|<IP address or URL>|10.10.0.126|g' openbao.sh
```

Make the file executable:

```bash
chmod +x bao.sh
```

Run the script with sudo:

```bash
sudo ./bao.sh
```
